### Loot Multiplier for Valheim - DropMoreLoot

This is a rebirth of Castix's Loot Multiplier mod.  Redone with permission from Castix  (SoCastix)      
Castix no longer had the source and gave me permission to rebuild it, add features and release to the gaming community.  

Credit to Castix for the original idea and awesome mod "Loot Multiplier".




> ### This mod does the following:

> - multiplies loot drops when you destroy, kill or pick up something. Drop multiplier can be configured.  
 
> - floating loot
> - configurable pickup range
> - item stacking
> - configurable whitelist - see below

### This mod is incompatible with Creature Level and Loot Control (CLLC) - Which is an amazing mod

Most, if not all of this mod's features are included in CLLC.  That being said, I've always liked the simplicity of this mod and have no desire to alter creature levels or need the sheer depth of settings and features that CLLC provides.
`This mod will fail to load if using CLLC.` I did this to keep DropMoreLoot from breaking features of CLLC which is an incredibly popular well written mod.  

Please don't create drama about this... I have no ill intent towards Smoothbrain (Blaxxun), the writter of CLLC.

Installation (manual)                                                                                       

If you are installing this manually, do the following
1. Extract the archive into a folder. **Do not extract into the game folder.**
2. Move the contents of `plugins` folder into `<GameDirectory>\Bepinex\plugins`.
3. Run the game.
4. To change the drop rate, use the config at \BepInEx\config\castix_LootMultiplier.cfg


How to set up the custom whitelist

1. Enable the whitelist in the Loot Multiplier config.
2. Open the whitelist.txt file. It always has to be in the same directory as the plugin .dll (example: <GameDirectory>\BepInEx\plugins\LootMultiplier\whitelist.txt)
3. Add items to the list by writing the Prefab name of the item you want. One per line.
4. If the whitelist is enabled, only the allowed items inside it will be multiplied.
